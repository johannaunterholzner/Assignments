        "For one repository, especially a remote repository, it is possible to have several branches. Besides the master branch, other people can work with the repository, using one branch each. This allows people to work together and merge their code at a later time. You can reuse your code and share it. But first, you have to fork a remote repository to your own remote repository. Then, you have to clone it to your local repository. When you work with the code from your local repository, you can track your code with git commit. Git commit takes a picture/snapshot of your code, and this specific step of your code is saved and you can go back to it, after some other changes or mistakes. After you are done with your work on your local repository, you have to synchronise it with your remote repository in order to be able to work with your code on a different device afterwards: you push your code to the remote repository. If you want to work with your code in your local repository, you have to first pull it from your remote repository. After that, you push it back to the remote repository - the cycle is closed."

        "The problem with strings is that computers/machines don't understand language, words, categorical values. Therefore, you have to convert it into numberical values to work with it. So first, all strings need to be preprocessed. In short, strings are devided into paragraphs, sentences, and at the end: into a list of words. For the next step, you have to establish all the unique words of the data set in a dictionary. Each unique word is assigned a certain place in the dictionary. Then, for each sentence, a vector is made which consits of numbers. These numbers represent how often one word of the unique words is present in the sentence. In the example above, the word \"bat\" is one of the unique words of the data set. In the second paragraph in the middle of the picture, \"bat\" is present twice. Therefore, the number 2 is added to the vector. But, for all words of the dictionary that are not present in this specific example, a 0 is added to the vector in the specific order of the dictionary of unique words. Therefore, \"at\" receives 0, as well as \"door\". But because \"can\" is present once in the sentence, it receives the value 1."
